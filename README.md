* Darim: Diary Improved
* Darim is a personal diary service that supports encryption, calendar view, and markdown syntax.
* You can keep your diary a secret even from the developer through client-side encryption.

## Architecture

* Darim is following the layered architecture.
* Each layer cannot be cross-referenced. All references between layers can flow in a higher direction. In other words, only the upper layer can invoke the lower layer members.
